#The letters Q, V and X are not used in the first position.

#The letters I, J and Z are not used in the second position.

#The only letters to appear in the third position are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, P, S, T, U and W when the structure starts with A9A.

#The only letters to appear in the fourth position are A, B, E, H, M, N, P, R, V, W, X and Y when the structure starts with AA9A.

#The final two letters do not use C, I, K, M, O or V, so as not to resemble digits or each other when hand-written.

#Postcode sectors are one of ten digits: 0 to 9, with 0 only used once 9 has been used in a post town, save for Croydon and Newport (see above).
